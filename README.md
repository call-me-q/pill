## What is PILL?

PILL stands for **Plan, Iterate, Launch, Live!** It's all about simplifying workflows, streamlining deployment, and making sure you have more time for coffee and memes. ‚òï

## Why PILL?

Building a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform from scratch can be a pain‚Äîbelieve me, I‚Äôve been there. I built PILL to solve this by providing a boilerplate that takes care of the basics, so you can focus on what really matters: your product. With PILL, you‚Äôre not just starting a project; you‚Äôre starting ahead. üöÄ

- **Plan**: Get a structured starting point for your SaaS project.
- **Iterate**: Rapidly refine and improve your ideas with ease.
- **Launch**: Easy deployment tools to get your app live faster.
- **Live**: Seamlessly deploy and scale your project.
