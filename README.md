## ❓ What is CAPSULE?

CAPSULE stands for **Code Always, Patching Services, Unexpectedly Losing Energy** — because let’s face it, building SaaS can feel like trying to build **_IKEA furniture without the manual_**. CAPSULE is here to streamline the chaos, save you from endless boilerplate, and (hopefully) keep you from pulling an all-nighter… again. 🌙

## 🤔 Why CAPSULE?

Building a SaaS platform from scratch is like juggling flaming swords 🔥⚔️: exciting at first, but quickly terrifying. CAPSULE simplifies the boring and frustrating parts so you can focus on what matters — like shipping features 🚢 and arguing over whether tabs or spaces are better 🤓.

- **Plan**: Start with a solid, no-fuss foundation 🧱.
- **Iterate**: Improve your app without spiraling into existential dread 🌀.
- **Launch**: Deploy like a pro 🚀… or at least like someone who knows what they’re doing 😅.
- **Live**: Maintain and scale without breaking a sweat 💦 (okay, maybe a little sweat).

CAPSULE: because your time is better spent drinking coffee ☕ and celebrating small wins 🎉.
